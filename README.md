### Things We Would Like You to Do with git:

- Make new branches and commits for changes
    - it makes sense to branch for new ideas/features and commits for changes within those ideas
- Commit and push as often as possible
- Write detailed commit messages so it is easier to debug code
- Pull changes frequently
- Make pull requests if you'd like to merge code (or just ask a project manager)
- Ask for help as soon as you get stuck
- Add all large files to gitignore 
- Try your best!

### Things We Would NOT Like You to do with git

- Do NOT merge branches without permission from one of the project managers
- Do NOT edit code outside of your branches unless absolutely necessary
- Do NOT commit files that are videos, datasets, large visualizations, or anything with a large file size
- Do NOT write pointless or empty commit messsages (`git blame` will find you!!!!)
